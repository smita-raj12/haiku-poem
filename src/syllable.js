//1. To find the number of syllables:
//---count the vowels in the word,
//---subtract any silent vowels, (like the silent "e" at the end of a word or the second vowel when two vowels a together in a //syllable)
//---subtract one vowel from every diphthong, (diphthongs only count as one vowel sound.)
//---the number of vowels sounds left is the same as the number of syllables.
//The number of syllables that you hear when you pronounce a word is the same as the number of vowels sounds heard. For example:
//The word "came" has 2 vowels, but the "e" is silent, leaving one vowel sound andone syllable.
//The word "outside" has 4 vowels, but the "e" is silent and the "ou" is a diphthong which counts as only one sound, so this /////word has only two vowels sounds and therefore, two syllables.
